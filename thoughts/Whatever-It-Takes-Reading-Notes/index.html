They give children a nuturing environement and teach them knowledge, habits and concepts that they would otherwised not be exposed to. I think of these services as a security net and a compass.
They also provide lessons to parents to have help them understand the effect of their action on their children&rsquo;s development. For programs targeting parents of younger children, these lessons are acommpanied with cash rewards and free lunches to attract parents. As the target age of the children increases, the amount of external incentives decreases and parents are encouraged to attend for the sake of their children.</p></li><li><p>they provide full-time programs to a selective group of children and part-time enrichment programs.
They create a pipeline to ensure that they see a small group of children through to adulthood. This pipeline defy the negative impact of their community.
They also open up enrichment classes to the wider community, so that the kids who did not go through the pipeline will be more ready to receive changes brought about by the kids who did.</p></li></ol><a href=#the-ladder><h4 id=the-ladder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The ladder:</h4></a><p>Canon Analogy: If you fired a cannon from the top of thre highest moutain inthe world, the cannonball might travel a long way, but it would eventually fall to earth beacuse of the power of gravity. And the faster you shot the canonnball, the farther it would travel before falling to earth. And if you shoot the cannonball fast enough, it will actually escape earth&rsquo;s gravity and go into orbit.</p><p>A single program for poor children is not enough to provide escape velocity, to give the children the momentum to orbit their communities and not be damaged. The gravity of the community always pulls the child back down, they may stay in the air for a year or to, but eventually, they will begin to fall closer and closer back down to the values and performance level of the community. A series of program is needed to escape velocity. The key is to intervene younger and guide them with external stimulation for as long as possible.</p><a href=#hczs-pipeline><h5 id=hczs-pipeline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>HCZ&rsquo;s pipeline:</h5></a><ul><li>Baby College<ul><li>Weekly parenting classes</li><li>Parents were not made to feel that they were inferior, or being given a favor.
