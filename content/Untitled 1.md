- I have gotten much better at multi-threading, or in other words, compartmentalizing my emotions. 
- Along the same vein, I realize that it is not healthy to bucket periods of time as good or bad, because things can be good and bad at the same time. When I found out about my roommate's passing, I was in denial for a really long time - I didn't want to allow myself to feel because I was making good strides and I didn't want her passing to affect my progress. It was selfish, I know. But what I learned was that my drive is strong enough to withstand whatever is thrown at me, I can mourn her passing and still keep charging forward. Good times and bad times can co-exists. It's not a zero sum game. 
- I am finding it hard to balance my technical interest in ML and my love for all things children and education. There's lots of thinking involved in both fields, but they tickly my brain in very different ways. I also found out that being a software engineer doesn't fully satisfy my brain's need to solve technical problems.. perhaps beacuse I am not working with much math. I am starting to realize that a good intersection of my interests could be enabling personalized learning with ML.. I think that's a good technical area to work on alongside my research.
- I realize that is really important to set aside time to _think and discuss_ after reading a book. It's easy to read a ton of books and feel like I am learning, but reading without thinking is nothing more than regurgitation of existing knowledge, it doesn't actually advance human understanding.
