#### C++ Review Session

`<<` : separators for what's displayed (similar to python + )
`cout << ""`: output to command line
`cint >> var`: input to command line
`using namespace` : may cause ambiguity if using multiple namespaces with the same variable name

- All methods / attributes are private unless declared public
- .cpp: source code, what's actually compiled 
- .h: describe functions / classes/ methods

- &: gives address occupied by variable
- * : dereference to get value 

##### memory can be allocated in the stack / heap

Stack:
- automatically deallocate when function returns 
`Rectangle rect = Rectangle()`
`rect.width`

Heap:
- has to explicit deallocate memory with `delete`
`Rectangle *rp = Rectangle()`
`Rectangle.width`

Pass by value vs Pass by reference Vs Pass by pointer

x++ vs ++x 

`auto`: automatically infers types based on the returning method
