Investigation strategy:

Lit survey
- Formal mathemtics manipulatives:
	- Educators
	- Learning Scientist 
	- Designers / Technologists 
	- [Characteristics of Classroom Mathematics Traditions: An Interactional Analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00028312029003573)
	- Magical Hope
- Traditional Math manipulatives 
	- catorgorization mostly based on what skill its meant to teach (ie. fraction, number line, place value etc)
	- Cuisenaire Rods
	- Mutli-based Arithmetic Blocks
- Montessori manipulatives 
- More Advanced Manipulatives

Bonus:
- Orgin of Manipulatives:
	- Boggan et al., 2010


List of classic manipulatives

#### Design principles of physical manipulatives 

concrete, representational, connecting

- Scaffolding - zone of proximal development 
	- Adult intervention vs clever physical design (control of error)
- Delayed Feedback / Immediate Feedback
- appropriate for different level of competency 
	- one tool can support multi level competencies
	- a series of tool to support different competencies
		- bunlding stick --> MAB
- represent ideas in more than one way
- mathematically accurate (and represent a mental model we typically use to think)


Why physical manipulatives:
- make abstract concept concrete and create mental models that children can use to think with
- give children a way to experiment and test their theories

Survey:
- Use of Montessori Manipulatives

#### Concrete Fadeness:
- Concrete action: 
	- Addition: join together
	- substraction: take away
	- multiplication: join the same quantity many times
