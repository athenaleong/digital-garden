Let experts do the teaching.
- psychological: 
	- transfering anxiety
	-  current teachers don't understand how their knowledge is used /  don't use the knowledge they impart in their everyday lives. "Because we love math", "Because we are curious"
- Genuine interest in the subject, convey in the way they teach. It's difficult to not fall in love with physics if you read Feynman. 
- "school science", "school math" which diverges greatly the sort of math 
- pitfall of experts is that they assume the wrong mental models of students / don't understand the progression of mental models
- figure of authority, convey prestige to teaching positions


parent involvement in children's education is either 'n' shape or a decreasing slope. 
discipline is a huge issue

counter argument:

teacher-centered school

less reliance on the teacher to convey information, mark assessments, plan lessons
