TO Knead in:
- we learn different subjects, not just to accumulate actual facts, but also to adopt different models of thinking. The methods of evaluation we adopt should biased towards these models of thinking. Requires meta-cognitive skill / inherent understanding of why we learn what we learn to know that. I certainly didn'y understand that in middle school. 

#### flow
- brother story
- dichotomy between what school wants us to think aboiut learning vs how mass education system is set up
- dichotomy between inner narrative and 
	- love for learning
- look into history of examination
	- move away from aristrocracy to meritocracy.
	- similiar problem as grains production - standardization of quality, credability of test score
	- In America, expeditated by war effort & eugnics belief 
	- built for external motivation (quote on this)
- current state of examination: education system has become a giant system of ranking instead of an environment for learning 
	- three general ways of examinations:
		- school assessment
		- national assessment
		- national examinations 
	- staircase model: honestly differ from country to country, but general structure is there
	- not only highs take for children, 
	- test score has become the north star of education and shape education system _without consideration of cognitive models
		- rest of our education system has been set up around ease of mass instruction and adminstering examinations  _
		- very top down
		- glamour of 'honor roll' and 'valedictorian'
		- "Will this be on the test"
		- sugar coating bitter medicine? decitful lies? good intentions gone to waste?
		- one dimension representation of intelligence 
	- perhaps humans are not grains after all
- Standardized system has its benefit
	- establish legimacy & legibility of education system
	- reflection of stable governance
	- accountability & 
	- the cyanical belief that efficiency and collective good over individual choice and happiness
- Testing's benefit on learning (perhas another article)
	- Our use of examination has overshadowed the inherent benefit of testing on learning
	- which actually came as a post-hoc realization
	- has cognitve basis, 
	- unable to use testing as  a learning tool
- What's next?
	- How then do we combine the good and the bad? perhaps of we step back and rebuild our education sytem now, it will look really different. but this is really a research question and one that concerns politics and governance
	- attempts to work around the system 
		- Montessori school : 
		- built upon the assumption of small network - quality of teacherw is built upon trust and evaluation by conscious parents and not external evaluation 
		- more thereotical: currently enforcement is top down, and learning is decentralized and measured -  it give a sense of perceived freedom. what if we start building components of education bottom up - create components with cognitive science basises
