Design:
- Pg 6 of Laski's What makes Mathematics Manipulatives Effective? Lessons from cognitve science and montessori 
- Possibility for infinite possibilities - need to ensure consistency in design
- introduction of physical constraints
- Montessori Education has subtle hinting, why, what is the psychology underpinning and how does it translate to the digital version?
- how does attention work? in-person: draw to focus since someone is talking to you. I have a hunch that children focus not becoz there's a voice involve, but rather becoz there's a person of higher authority. Otherwise, children focus because they are intrigued (ie. it's a new concept, storytelling)
- implicit convey of constraint vs explicit convey to constraint
