flexible assessment 

other factors to look into:
- pyschology of testing - how does presence of test affects motivation
- time pressure in examination
- student's perception of testing 
- how does standardized testing affect instruction focus 

interesting visualizations:
- map of frequency of test 
- index of importance of test on future outcome

Student tend to 'cram' for exams. This is great for short-term memory retrieval, but bad for long term knowledge retention. Related [Spaced Practice](notes/Spaced%20Practice.md)

Traditional school structure not ideal for long term memory retention
- Schools often include a revision period of a few weeks leading up to high-stakes cumulative exasms. 
- School curiculum tend to teach a topic once and then intensely review the topics with students weeks before the exams, instead of encouraging spaced practice

assumption that test score is a reliable index of performance 

exam practice may lend to over-optimization for exam format rather than familiarizing with the material itself

Testing as a form of [Retrieval Practice](notes/Retrieval%20Practice.md), there are other forms of retrieval practice, ie. concept mapping 

But high pressure exam may undermine the effect of retrieval practice: . On the quizzes themselves, students performed equally well. However, those in the high-pressure condition did not perform as well on a criterion test later compared to the low-pressure group. Thus, test anxiety may reduce the learning benefit of retrieval practice. See [Hinze & Rapp](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3032)

For example, research by Weinstein, Gilmore, Szpunar, and McDermott ([2014](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-12170-001) ) demonstrated that when students expected to be tested, the increased test expectancy led to better-quality encoding of new information. Frequent testing can also serve to decrease mind-wandering – that is, thoughts that are unrelated to the material that students are supposed to be studying (Szpunar, Khan, & Schacter, [2013](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1221764110)

Limitation of current research on testing:
- Studies are often done with simple laboratory materials (word or paired associate lists) which differs from actual content
- Studies are done in the time frame of weeks, which may not be reflective of long term knowledge retention / application
- does not account for [Transfer Approriate Processing](notes/Learning%20theory.md#Transfer%20Approriate%20Processing)


Format of LAS discourages testing to be seen as a learning resource:
- no feedback given
- seen as a gatekeeper, a means to an end- no revision needed 
- encourages crammping 

students don't quite see testing as a study resource 

So should we regularly schedule mid-stake / low-stake examination?

Just how reflective / effective is test score on our ability

Should kids even be evaluated?
