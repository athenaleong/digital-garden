Student tend to 'cram' for exams. This is great for short-term memory retrieval, but bad for long term knowledge retention. Related [Spaced Practice](notes/Spaced%20Practice.md)

Traditional school structure not ideal for long term memory retention
- Schools often include a revision period of a few weeks leading up to high-stakes cumulative exasms. 
- School curiculum tend to teach a topic once and then intensely review the topics with students weeks before the exams, instead of encouraging spaced practice

assumption that test score is a reliable index of performance 

exam practice may lend to over-optimization for exam format rather than familiarizing with the material itself

Testing as a form of [Retrieval Practice](notes/Retrieval%20Practice.md), there are other forms of retrieval practice, ie. concept mapping 

But high pressure exam may undermine the effect of retrieval practice: . On the quizzes themselves, students performed equally well. However, those in the high-pressure condition did not perform as well on a criterion test later compared to the low-pressure group. Thus, test anxiety may reduce the learning benefit of retrieval practice. See [Hinze & Rapp](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.3032)

For example, research by Weinstein, Gilmore, Szpunar, and McDermott ([2014](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-12170-001) ) demonstrated that when students expected to be tested, the increased test expectancy led to better-quality encoding of new information. Frequent testing can also serve to decrease mind-wandering – that is, thoughts that are unrelated to the material that students are supposed to be studying (Szpunar, Khan, & Schacter, [2013](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1221764110)
