title: "What are we working towards?"

It's easy to lose track of the bigger picture when I am nose-deep in literature. 
It's easy to lose hope when the thing I am trying to understand just seems so complex, confusing and burdened with inertia. I came out with the list to give myself clarity, to remind myself of what I am trying to work towards.

 I hope to live in a world where everyone posseses these important traits and knowledge. 

**Traits:**
- Curious & thoughtful: an open-minded person who think for themselves and can confidently ask questions, question answers and understand the world around them
- Kind & Empathetic: someone who treats everyone and eveything with love and gentleness
- Grit & Conscientious : someone who is determined and persistent in pursuing their long term goals, and takes responsibility for their actions and mistakes
- Mindful: someone who have strong awareness of their thoughts and surroundings, and can recognize, regulate and express their emotions
- Integrity: someone who is honest and make morally right decisions, even in the face of adversity
- Playful: someone who can skip down the street, let loose and have fun.

**Knowledge:**
- logic, statistics and math knowledge for everyday living 
- Literacy to confidently read any text and communicate their thoughts in speech and writing
- Knowledge in nutrition, basic cooking and healthy living
- Financial Literacy 
- Other life skills relevant to their area (ie. traffic safety, swimming, mountaineering)

**I want to schools to be seen as:**
- dedicated space in the community designed for children, where everything is "just right"
- a HQ children can return to after learning in the community / online
- a safe place with resources and events 
- home to a group of adult experts ready to champion and assist
- place to socialize and befriend

**I don't want school to be seen as:**
- endless tests, deadlines and homeworks that are out of children's control
- the only place for learning 
- a means to an end
- a childcare facility
