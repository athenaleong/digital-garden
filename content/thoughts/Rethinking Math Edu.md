Education is the formalization of learning. A standardized education curriculum ensures that all humans are equipped with the basic skills to navigate life. 

There are a few ways in which the current math curriculum contributes to this overall objective :
1. Learning skills / models of thinking that are useful for day-to-day living 
2. Learning how to learn (ie. frameworks of thinking)
3. Learning problem-solving skills 

Only a small percentage of math topics actually contribute to our development in the first way. (Think arithmetic, fraction, probability and statistical thinking etc). The rest of the math skills we learn (think quadratic equations) aren't actually that practical. They contribute to our learning largely through the second and third ways. But there are many ways to accomplish these implicit goals, and forcing children to learn uninteresting theorems they can't relate to definitely isn't effective.

My thinking is that only the most important topic should be part of the compulsory math syllabus. Instead of teaching lots of math topics poorly, we should teach a selective group of topics extremely well and ensure a high level of mastery.
