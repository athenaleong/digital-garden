Concerns of universal Transitional Kindergarten 
- onboarding: discontinuity - how do we bridge social cutlure environment to a standardized environment 
- How do we provide individualized attention:  4 year old need help with self-regulation - irrational to put 25 of them in a classroom with a teacher
	- behavior based: experiment in Maryland where teachers visit student at home prior to visiting 
- How do we provide contuinity of care? 
- Teacher have implicit baised and we are extending that bias to an even younger age.
- How do we bridge the secregation between preschool and elementary school. The change is jarring. preschool - warmth, care fun. "preschool know alot about child before they come in". elementary school is academic focused.
