#### Three development that has complicated parenting:
1. Freedom of choice: People used to have kids because it was customary, economically necessary, or it was a moral obligation. Now people have a much greater say on whether they want to have kids and how they want to parent (ie. how far apart each kid should be). Children are seen as a ambitious life project. There's a lot more #ego involved. 
2. Changing work culture: Gender roles are no longer fixed. Women are working more and men are taking up an increasing amount of household work. Families are learning to navigate this changing structure. 
3. Changing role of children in society: children are seen as future assets. "economically useless and emotinally priceless" (Question: is this a choice or is this a result of economic condition). Parent pour more capital into children (is this a result of children being seen a future asset or the other way round)

#### Why having children is all joy and no fun:
- Children have drastic effect on sleep. The effect of sleep deprivation is supposedly greatly determined by genetics. Some people respond to sleep deprivation catastrophically.
- Having children is a test of our willpower. Self-control is a bottomless resource. The more willpower we expand in one area (ie. parenting and sleep), the more likely we will yield to the next temptations that come along (ie. yelling at our kids). Succumbing to our own temptation is no fun. 
- Children are madman : their chaos challenge the organization adults have established. Psychologically healthy kindergarteners from high-income homes listen to their mothers 55% of the time, low in-come homes 68%
- Gain in freedom is a seen as a triumph of subtraction rather than addition (ie. getting rid of stuff, instead of taking up stuff of our choice). Independence came to mean immunity from social claims on one's wealth or time. We fear commitment and we  perceive liberty as freedom from obligation. Children are the most binding obligations. 
- Reality vs Expectations of having children: Couples usually view children as matrimonial enhancers, but in fact, couples with young children are more prone to divorce. 
	- Children are the most common topic of argument (this is old study, not sure how true this is)
		- The nature of parenting differs based on gender roles. Mothers tend to do more 'routein' parenting while dads tend to do more 'interactive' parenting. So even if as couple is doing an even amount of childcare, it may not be perceived as fair.
		- Perceived imbalance in childcare is more likely to affect marital happiness than perceived imbalance in household chores. There's a few pausible reasons.
			-  imbalances in childcare (ie. not spending enough time with kid) are perceived to affect children's future (ie. the effect of an absent father on children).
			- childcare is more cognitive demanding
			- children are seen as a mutually agreed upon decisions between a couple
- Child rearing disrupts #flow : divided attention, lack of clear success condition
- Children takes up #mental-real-estate: #guilt, anxiety 

#### Some ideas on how child-rearing affects marriage 
- Children are often prioritized over partners. Likely due to the sense of #guilt associated with children.


#### Why then do we continue to have children?

#### Good analogies:
- Adults have spotloight consciousness and small children have lantern liked consciousness. 
- Children are very focused on the present. Everyone is moving at the same speed towards the future, but young children are moving at the same speed with their eyes closed. 
	- This could explain why children are bad at stopping activities (ie. "Let's go home now and we will come back some other day"). They have a hard time understanding the future.

Personal privacy and liberty to pursue one's interest is a modern concept. The #architecture of the typical Puritian home consists of one main room, which conspired against solitude. 

Along the same vein, pervasive busyness is also a modern concept. This led to the decline of #mutual-aid and #pop-ins.

#Guilt is an emotion that becomes prominent during parenthood. Parents feel a need to give their very best to their children. This applies both materialistically (ie. school, toys) and non-materialisitically (time). But there is no limit to what constitues best, there's always something more a parent can do. This constant feel of not doing enough leads to guilt. 

- should parental love be more conditional?
