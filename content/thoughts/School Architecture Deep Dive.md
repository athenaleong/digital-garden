**Pre-civil war:**
Concept of schooling is tied strongly to the school house 

Conversion from one-room school house to larger education institution
- galvanize support for universal education
- improve student experience
- elevate teacheer status 

**Civil War & Post civil war period:**
- dependence on children's salary for survival 
- ~ 6 % of 14 - 18 yo Americans were enrolled in high school

When the concept of childhood is recognised, new law enforced to get children off the job and into schools. This led to a large influx of students and the construction of new schools. Guidlines for ideal classroom design + hygiene is introduced.

Introduction of purpose-built rooms. Introduction of school plans and facades (ex. H-plan) - (fundamentally disagree with this becoz it standardizes education experiences)

**1930 - 1960s:**
- Popularization of whole child approach. built schools with concerns about light, air, cleanliness etc. Popularization of outdoor education - indoor classroom paired with outdoor garden
- Schools were typically single story, surrounded by open space, with large central room that serve as gymansium, cafeteria, library etc. 
- Creation of Cummins Foundation Architecture Program in Columbus, Indiana which sparked innovation in school architecture 
	-  Schmitt Elementary (Multiple one room school house linked together)
	- Mcdowell Elementary (Clusters of classrooms at each corner of the school and common space in the middle)


**Late 1960s:**
- birth of continuous progress school - L. Frances Smith Elementary
- emphasis of light, space & belonging

Stairless design with teachers and administrators at the top

**1970s:**
- Popularization of open education (open plan school)
	- Mt. Healthy Elementary school : reverted back to traditional classroom design becoz open plan was too loud
- Reasons open plan didn't work:
	1. Too loud --> highly distracting
	2. Needs to be complemented with changes in pedagogy and change in teacher's mindsets
	3. Inability to measure outcome, which didn't sit well with the pragmatic mindset during economic down turn



**Case Studies**
**Delf Montessori School:**

L-shape classroom positioned closely to prevent formation of long corridors. Inspiration for many design in the 70s.

**Recent Trends**
- Revert to previous open-plan design with glass walls 
- Creation of small villages / communities within a big school
- reverting to one room school house concept (microschool)
- Creative furnitures & Flexible seating

**Personal Take:**
- I like the idea of a facility that is completely designed to fit a kid's needs, but i don't like the idea that this facility is where ALL learning is contained. Schools should feel like a secure base so that learning can take place anywhere in the community. 
- Interesting exercise to do could be figure out the anatomy of a school hierarchy and think about how they can be restructured
