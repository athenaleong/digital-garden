[Self-Compassion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-compassion]: extending compassion to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general suffering.

Three components of self-compassion:

1. Self-kindness:  being warm and understanding toward ourselves, withholding judgement of ourselves
2. Common Humanity: recognizing that suffering and personal inadequacy is part of the shared human experience
3. Mindfulness: mental clarity regarding emotion and mental state



A few swirling thoughts:

- Too much empathy is detrimental to one's wellbeing. I have an inkling that self-compassion could be the answer to hyperempathy & caregiver fatigue. 
- Self-compassion is far from selfish, it is the key to life-long compassion and perfect empathy.  
- How does self-compassion develop? If the intuition that sympathy --> empathy --> compassion is true. When and where does self-compassion come in?
