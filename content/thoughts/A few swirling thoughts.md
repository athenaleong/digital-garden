- Both of my friends who came to me about their problems recently went in circles about the same few points. I find myself making this mistake all the time too - It's very easy to fall into the same spiral of thoughts when the problem has no ideal solution. Sometimes, It's just more comforting to dwell on 'what to do' then actually doing it. But that's extremely unproductive and really bad for long term happiness! Knowing when to step out of the spiral and just deal with the problem seems like an extremely important skill.
- I have a vague feeling that my degree of self-compassion is inversely correlated with my degree of definite optimism. I'm still trying to figure out why.
 - Overdependency on things outside of my control is one of the most draining things I have experienced. 
- I haven't been very well physcially and I realized how much I take my health for granted. I find the process of figuring out what is important really passive - we have to lose something in order to understand its true value. What are some ways to change that? 
- I realized that some of the best builders I know don't promote themselves and some of the best promoters (people who claim to build or who talks about building on social media) never actually builds.
