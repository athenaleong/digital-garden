I want to train a #GPT-3 Model that's really good at asking follow up questions. This model could be used for introspection, interview or understanding purposes. I envision a website, where I can type / speak and a follow up question will pop up based on my response. For the basic MVP, I am only looking for additional questions, and no other forms of dialogues or interactions. 

Conditions for #flow:
- happens apart from everyday life
- usually involves heightened sense of control, because it signals probability of success 
- environment with clear-cut rules, goals and immediate feedback
