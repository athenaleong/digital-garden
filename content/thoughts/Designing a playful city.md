How can we make cities more playful? Collective play makes you feel alive, it is one of the best way to connect with those around you! The exploratorium is great at doing this. The exhibit where you need to hold hands with others in order to activate the music is simply magical. You need to work collectively to make something happen -  It brings people together! The act of holding hands breaks the physcial barrier in a fun and non-threatning way. It brings happiness to not just the participants but also the beholders. When happiness is shared, it is amplified (though it should still feel exlcusive / maintain the feeling of huamn connection) . When we play collectively, it feels like we are harmonising on a whole different universe!

Features of a more playful city:
-  Collaboration. (think 4 ppl snake game where each person controls a direction)
- Work with mediums that has feel good effect (think music, solving puzzles)
- Enabling medium. People can use thier imagination and creativity to make the play special.
