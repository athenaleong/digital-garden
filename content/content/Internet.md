What is TCP IP?

Does tiktok access the wifi network
Is it possible then that they can access other devices on the wifi network

 Alright, I dont want to get into the politics, but Mr congress man, I think we need a crash course on how home wifi network works.

So you have probably seen these things around your house. They are called routers. They connect to the internet through physical wires. Now we have our devices like your phone or the ipad, or may be you know your smart fridge, and you want to connect it to the internet, To do this, we first need these devices to communicate with the aforementioned routers. 
 
So iPad and router talk.

No they dont speak like humans do. They send 1s and 0s through radiowaves.

There's no physical wires connecting your phone to the router. Instead it connects over "wifi" which stands for wireless fidelity. 

So mr congressman you ask "Does tiktok access the wifi network"

Well tiktok wouldn't work without access to the internet. And connecting over "wifi: is one way we can do that. We can also do that through cellular data,

Okay so, Is it possible then that they can access other devices on the wifi network?

"Access" is probably not the right word. Applications on the same wifi network (which means they are connected to the same router) can communicate with each other. But this really depends on the configuration of your network. 

(walk to light switch and flip light switch)
Also, since informations is transmitted over radiowaves which is sort of just around. We can totally just read it.  Think about it this way, if you turn on a light in the room,  you can't expect other people in the room to not totally see the light as well right? The same goes for radio waves.

(walk to computer, sit down, change view to laptop)
So I downloaded application called Wireshark. And this is all the infromation it has snooped. You have the sender address and the destination address, and some other meta information, but everything else is all just gibberishes.

They are gibberish because they are encrypted!! so if you are sending over information like your credit card details, people can't just snoob it. 

so now  you know 










Devices communicate with "" through radio waves.

congressman:
- wifi access point (connected to internet through wires, tbh it's alot more complicated than that)
- our devices communicate with wireless access point through radiowaves 
- convert information to 1010101, send theses 1s and 0s through radio waves 
- of course - if it is not encrypted, then anyone can intercept this message, wireless encrption standards --> scrambling the information, so the snobber has no idea what they are loooking at 
- public wifi : guest isolation
