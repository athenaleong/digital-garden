Capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them

Experiments to establish theory of mind:
- First-order false belief task: Smarties Task #Gopnik
- Second-order false belief task: Sally-Ann Task
- For younger children: preferential looking paradigm

Five aspects of ToM that develop sequentially:
- diverse desires
- diverse beliefs
- knowledge access (seeing leads to knowing)
- false beliefs 
- hidden emotions (belief differs from action)

Children in Iran & China develop knowledge access before diverse desires due to culture of collectivism
