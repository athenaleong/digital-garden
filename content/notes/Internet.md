Wireshark:
- Wireshark captures network traffic using a network interface card (NIC) or adapter installed on the computer where it's running. The NIC is responsible for transmitting and receiving data packets over the network.
- When capturing network traffic, Wireshark puts the NIC into _promiscuous mode_, which allows it to capture all packets on the network segment to which it's connected, regardless of the packet's destination. By default, NICs are configured to only receive packets addressed to their specific MAC address, so putting the NIC into promiscuous mode is necessary to capture all packets on the network.
