#### Adaptive Engram cell plasticity 

_Source_: [Forgetting as a form of adaptive engram cell plasticity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-021-00548-3)

Based on theory that memories are stored in ensembles of neurons ('engram  cells') and success fo recall involves reactivation of these ensembles. 

Forgetting involves circuit remodelling that switches engram cells from an accessible state to an inaccessible state. Forgetting is a form of neuroplasticity that alters engram cell accessibility in a manner that is sensitive to the mismatch between expectations and the environment.
