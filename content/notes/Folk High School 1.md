#### General School information
- Folk high school for 16 - 19 year old. Hosts around 80 - 90 students every semester. 
- Program is heavily subsidized by Danish government. Students pay $160 for room, board and learning, and the govenment pays around twice that amount for every student if student stays for at least 2 semesters. 
- 20% of the students here are internaional and 80% are Danish. The school accepts everyone that apply as long as they are able to understand English instructions.

#### Classes
- There are 3 periods every semesters and students take 3 classes every period.
- Classes are led by teachers and are designed around what they do/ their interest. For example, my guide Krisitian is a professional photographer and he teaches the photography class. 
- Huge focus on embodied and hands on learning. Example of classes: Skateboarding class, where students make their own skateboard and learn how to ride it. Ceremic class. Leather working class. Esport class. Yoga class. Class where students watch film and discuss about it.
- Classes are designed to teach students about life through different medium. For example, Krisitian talked about loneliness and how pervasive it is and had students expressed that feeling of loneliness through different photography techniques. 
- Classes are well supported with good facilities. I visited a gym, a dark room, photogrpahy studio, videography studio, computer lab, ceremic lab, leather workshop, garden, Skateboard ramp etc. 
- Homeworks are "illegal". The school hope that students will tak

#### Culture 
_as described by Kristian_
"We give them the playgroud and teach them about the equipment. Hey! This is the seesaw and it can do it. But it is up to them to do the playing and how they want to play."
- Students are encouraged to fail and keep trying.
- There are two volunteers who stay with the school for around a year. They bridge the gap between the teachers and the students: They may take classes with students and assist teachers at the same time. Think of them like TAs. They model good mindset for the students! Pierre, the volunteer I met, spoke about how he let himself fall . "I tried to show them that it is okay to fail for a good reason." 
- Period to seek themsleves out
