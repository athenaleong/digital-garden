Notes and thoughts on "Tools that Lower the Floors, Widen the Walls, and Raise the Ceilings for Designing Creative Learning Experiences" (Thesis by Yusuf Ahmad)

---

#### Overview:
Traditional lesson plans takes the form of a material supply list and a script for teachers. It conveys what information needs to be transfered and not how to create the overall learning experience. Thesis investigates better tool for teachers to plan, draft ideas and prototype learning experiences.

#### Design Principles:
- Tinkerable
	- Offer low-stake drafting of ideas. 
	- Limited set of LEGO bricks (ie. Trello) is too rigid for free expression of ideas. ( #low-ceiling)
	- Too many features / too much lego bricks (ie. AdobeXD) makes it high friction to pick up and too complicated to use. ( #high-floor)
- Personal
- Collaborative
	- Ability to sense other's presence (ie. cursor)

#### Interesting ideas:
- Limiting formating may be a generative constraints that encourage candidates to focus on substance over form.
- Current digital planning tools for teachers feel high stake, with high emphasis on form. Teachers actually find it more "free", and easier to "
  mess around with ideas" when working with analog tools.
- Teacher as a "designer" which curates / creates educational; experiences rather than a deliverer of information. (Similar to [Reggio Emilia](notes/Reggio%20Emilia.md)])

#### Questions: 
- Paper seems to target classroom where teacher dictate the flow of learning. What's the design process of non-teacher led learning or online learning? How would tools for those types of learning differ?
- What makes Powerpoints / Google Slide such a ubiquitous tools for teachers? 

> "As a classroom community, our capacity to generate excitement is deeply affected by our interest in one another, in hearing one another's voice, in recognizing one another's presence. Sinçe the majority of students learn through conservative, traditional educational practices and concern themselves only with the presence of the professor, any radical pedagogy must insist that everyone's presence is acknowledged. That insistence can not be simply stated. It has to be demonstrated through pedadgogical practices."

\- bell hocks, "Teaching to Transgress"

- How do we convey presence in a digital learning space? How does the nature of "presence" change in an online community?
