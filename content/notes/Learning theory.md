Student will allocate time to learn the most difficult items that they will be able to learn in the time frame. With limited time, students tend to study not the most difficult material, but material in the region just outside of their current understanding.

#### Transfer Approriate Processing

Increased memory performances when prior processing matches processing required for a subsequent test


#### Relational and Instrumental Understanding

Instrumental Understanding: understanding of rules without reasons, centered around rote knowing, also known as procedural knowledge

Relational Understanding: fundemantal understanding of concepts that generalizes, also known as conceptual understanding, and connected knowledge 

#### Cognitive Load Thoery

Built on the assumption that learning is the _construction_ and _automation_ of schemas. While being constructed, the information held by schemas is essentially borrowed, via the borrowing or reorganizing principle, from schemas held by others. 

Postulates that learning via discovery is ineffective and inferior to learning via well-designed instruction.

Postulates that learners have limited working memory. Cognitive load during learning is deteremined by the demands on working memory by cognitive activities designed to achieve specific learning goals.

Three sources of cognitive load:
1. Intrinsic cognitive load
	- magnitude of intrinsic cognitive load is determined by the degree of interactivity between the individual learning elements relative to the level of learner expertise in the domain
2. Extraneous cognitive load
	- cognitive load attributed to the design of the instruction
3. Germane cognitive load

Instructors tend to take the Cognitive conflicts between mismatching instruction-based cognitive models and learner's simplified internal knowledge structures may increase processing demands on limited working memory
