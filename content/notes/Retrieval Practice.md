The process of withdrawing learned information from long-term memory into working memory. Retrieval practice is generally categorised into two forms: covert retrieval, which occues in the mind and overt retrieval, where information is produced in some phyiscal form (ie. mind mapping, verbal explaination). 

The act of retrieval improves our memory of the information, even when feedback is not provided.

The benefit of retrieval practice comes from the act of retrieval and not the correct production of information. (Though it is debatable that the correct production of information may indicate more effortful retrieval). Successful retrievals produce the same effect as unsucessful retrievals as long as feedback was provided.

Retrieval practices should feel effortful, and not when information is still in working memory.

If retrieval success is extremely low, then it is unlikely to improve memory, particularly in the absense of feedback.
