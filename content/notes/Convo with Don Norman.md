A: You can't. Band together. 
Politics focuses on human behaviour

Design should not be lumped with art. Designers are often in the middle layer of the company. There is no Chief Design Officer in major companies. They have no agency. Need to re-educate designers in business, politics, and especially literature. People in literature study human psychology as a whole, versus psychologists who only study a sliver of human nature. Designers need to get better at selling themselves to executives. Takes on hats similar to marketing, projecting sales and speaking the language of business. 

society as social-technical system
structural changes: move away from profit-driven model

This can be done through education. 

Humans are not very good at responding to future problems, but very good at responding to current problems.

Comparing the invention of photography with the invention of generative AI. People were sceptical about photography because it would take away jobs, but it created a whole sector of new jobs.
