Main point of the reform is to reduce excessive paperwork and evidence collection so teachers can spend more time interacting with students. There's greater trust in teacher's judgement.

Assessment is observational, informative and feed into interactions with children. EYFS Profile (EYFSP) is not an accountability measure, but an end of year assessment to inform teachers and parents to support student's transition. External moderation of assessment is removed, only internal moderation is done. 

EYFS Profile data are collected to inform policy and research. This data are not published at a school level, and schools will not be held accountable.
