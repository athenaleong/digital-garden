- Humans learn by constructing new mental models to describe novel situations. As we acquire more knowledge, new mental models are built upon exisiting mental models. For example, we use counting to understand addition, then use addition to understand multiplication. Another example could be understanding Montachondra as the powerhouse of the cell. Schooling is pretty much the process of delivering these wide-usedly mental models to children. 
- It's very easy to regergitate exisiting models of thinking and spot their relevance to everyday life but it is extremely difficult to synthesis new ones. For example, Don Norman introduced the concept of 'affordance' in his book 'The Design of everyday things'. It took him years of observation and thinking to construct the concept of 'affordance'. But within 15 minutes of reading his book, I now am able to identify the affordances of objects and try to design product with affordance in mind. 
- Question:
	- How do you define models of thinking? When Wesley learned techniques of word search from me, what mental model was he constructing? What's the difference between knowledge and models of thinking? Most models of thinking I can actively recall are very generalizable (ie. concerted cultivation by Annette Lareau, self-determination theory) - is that a criteria? Is it meaningful to further distill models of thinking by type?
	- connection? 
	- On why we stop playing. My hypothesis is that the level of surprise for adults decrease as we explore more. Counter argument: It's not about what you know, but the curiosity about what you dont know.

- We rely on intuition a lot when we carry out everyday action. Intuition are often fuzzily defined by our past experiences. Constructing models of thinking is the process of converting these fuzzy thinking into an algorithm so that it is easily transferable. (Azlen's design of wriitng like video editing or me outlining the fundamental principles of play to Anna) like ofcourse I do that now or I have thought about that, good design is constructing interfaces for good models of thinking.  around fuzzWhen a new model of thinking is introduced

- Play becomes learning what it allows us to explore new models of the world. The complexity of the medium of play, aka our toys, increases as we age.
