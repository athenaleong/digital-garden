#### Problem Solving 

Learning technice where different ideas or problem types are tackled in a sequence as opposed to the more common method of blocking, where multiple versions of the same problems are attempted in the same study session. 

Interleaving multiple problem types help students acquire the ability to choose the right method for solving different types of problems rather than learning only the method itself without understanding its application.
