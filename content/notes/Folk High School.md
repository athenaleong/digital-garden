A [folk high school](https://danishfolkhighschools.com/media/11348/19-danishfolkhighschool-haefte-web.pdf) is a non-formal residential school offering learning opportunities in almost any subject. Most students are between 18 and 24 years old and the length of a typical stay is 4 months. It is a boarding school, so you sleep, eat, study and spend your spare time at the school. There are no academic requirements for admittance, and there are no exams - but you will get a diploma as a proof of your attendance.

Teachers and students live in the same community and hang out outside of formal classes, as inspired by the Cambridge college models
