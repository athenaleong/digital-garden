Q: What is the appeal of repeating nursery rhyme to young children?

---

Young children do not have the mental model to understand affordance of a toy. Hence products for kids are almost never used the way they are intended to be used. Toys should be designed to be all enabling, and provide multiple level of abstraction for kids with varying abilities.
