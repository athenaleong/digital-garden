Most students are between 18 and 24 years old and the length of a typical stay is 4 months. It is a boarding school, so you sleep, eat, study and spend your spare time at the school. There are no academic requirements for admittance, and there are no exams - but you will get a diploma as a proof of your attendance.\n\nTeachers and students live in the same community and hang out outside of formal classes, as inspired by the Cambridge college models \n\n![Map](/notes/images/type-of-folk-high-schools-in-denmark.png)\n\nVisiting International People's College\n\n7.30AM - 8.00AM: Breakfast - most students were still slightly dazzy but there was a considerable amount of chatter in the dinning room. Students helped themselves to a spread of toast, jams, yogurt, milk and cereals. Breakfast wrapped up promptly at 8.00AM, and late comers had to grab a quick bite in the common area.\n\n8.30AM: Morning fellowship in the newly constructed auditorium. It starts with a few minutes of singing. It felt really warm and fuzzy when everyone sang together, and the voices got louder as the song went on. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeacher was invited outside of the classroom so students can have an unbiased discussion without teacher influence. There were a show of hands on student's interests of the topic and people were unafriad to share their opinions even though when it is unpopular. There were students who were deeply passionate about the topic and those who won't so much.Those managing the dicussion were careful to consider everyone's opinon and did checks multiple times to make sure everyone was on the same page and had no concerns with the agreed upon solution. Eventually they reached compromise on a solution such that those who are passionate are able to read about them and share the outocme.\n\nTeacher Julie was then invited back in and presented with the student's compromise.

Classical: Formal definition of probabilities in terms of sample spaces of equally likely events, based on a strict set of axioms. Defines probability as a fraction of the number of favorables cases to a particular event divided by the number of all cases possible. Common example: ball being selected from urns\n2. Frequentist: Defines probability of an event as the long-run relative frequency of the event. In other words, the number in which freqency of the event tend towards when an experiment is repeated an infinite number of times. Often taught via simulation. \n\t- Good for confirming intuition, but needs to be complemented with classical approach to understand the 'why?'\n3. Subjective: Defines probability as a degree of belief, based upon personal judgement and information about an outcome, in which the reptition of the same situation is no longer necessary to give a sense to probability. \n\t- Could be introduced at a more advance level, to help students understand that probabilitic thinking is not fully rational and require subjective input. \n\n\t![Approach to teaching probability in Singapore, US and Indonesia](/thoughts/images/teaching-approach-probability.jpeg)\n\n#### A few ways to distinguish Math textbook:\n- Representation forms. Representing math concepts as purely mathematical, written, visual or combined forms. \n- Cogntive demand levels. What level of cognitive demand does textbook question afford? Low cognitive demand - memorization, procedures without connection. High cognitive demand  - Procedure with connection, open-ended math problem. \n- Contextual features. How relevant is problem context to student's everyday life?\n\n#### Synthesising\nWhy teach probability? \n- Framework for thinking and sound decision making. \n\n*Logical understanding* on how probability works is indispensable to the key to the transferability of probabilitistic concepts to real life scenarios. This can best be achieved by setting questions with high cognitive demand, in addition to providing high contextualized examples. \n\nIndonesian textbook sets questions that are high contextualized, but requires low cognitive demand. Their students report low performance on context-based mathemtics tasks; Only 1% of their students could work with context-based problems in complex situations. This is because they do not fundamentally understand the concepts of probability. Completing taks that requires higher congitive demand levels can faciliate a *productive struggle* which helps them make missing connections. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-26T20:39:56.229031672Z","tags":null},"/notes/Waldorf-Education":{"title":"Waldorf Education","content":"\nFound in Germany, United States, and Netherlands. \n\nSeparation into 3 different stages based on stages of development (similiar to Jean Piaget)\n\n#spiral-curiculumn : Main academic subjects are introduced through two-hour morning lesson blocks that last for several weeks.

Freedom of choice: People used to have kids because it was customary, economically necessary, or it was a moral obligation. Now people have a much greater say on whether they want to have kids and how they want to parent (ie. how far apart each kid should be). Children are seen as a ambitious life project. There's a lot more #ego involved. \n2. Changing work culture: Gender roles are no longer fixed. Women are working more and men are taking up an increasing amount of household work. Families are learning to navigate this changing structure. \n3. Changing role of families \u0026 children in society: \n\t- Children are seen as future assets. \"economically useless and emotinally priceless\". Parent pour more capital into children. Children demand more independence, but are increasingly dependent on their parents for resources, emotional support and connections.\n\t- Traditional functions of parents have changed. Parents used to provide educational, vocational, and religious instruction to their children, but this has now been outsourced to larger institutions. The sole job of parents become the financial, physical and emotional security of their children. \n\n\t\n#### Why having children is all joy and no fun:\n\n##### Early Childhood:\n- Children have drastic effect on sleep. The effect of sleep deprivation is supposedly greatly determined by genetics. Some people respond to sleep deprivation catastrophically.\n- Having children is a test of our willpower. Self-control is a bottomless resource. The more willpower we expand in one area (ie. parenting and sleep), the more likely we will yield to the next temptations that come along (ie. yelling at our kids). Succumbing to our own temptation is no fun. \n- Children are madman: their chaos challenge the organization adults have established. Psychologically healthy kindergarteners from high-income homes listen to their mothers 55% of the time, low-income homes 68%\n- Gain in freedom is a seen as a triumph of subtraction rather than addition (ie. getting rid of stuff, instead of taking up stuff of our choice). Independence came to mean immunity from social claims on one's wealth or time. We fear commitment and we perceive liberty as freedom from obligation. Children are the most binding obligations. \n- Reality vs Expectations of having children: Couples usually view children as matrimonial enhancers, but in fact, couples with young children are more prone to divorce. \n\t- Children are the most common topic of argument (this is old study, not sure how true this is)\n\t\t- The nature of parenting differs based on gender roles. Mothers tend to do more 'routine' parenting while dads tend to do more 'interactive' parenting. So even if as couple is doing an even amount of childcare, it may not be perceived as fair.\n\t\t- Perceived imbalance in childcare is more likely to affect marital happiness than perceived imbalance in household chores. There's a few pausible reasons.\n\t\t\t-  imbalances in childcare (ie. not spending enough time with kid) are perceived to affect children's future (ie. the effect of an absent father on children).\n\t\t\t- childcare is more cognitive demanding\n\t\t\t- children are seen as a mutually agreed upon decisions between a couple\n- Child rearing disrupts #flow : divided attention, lack of clear success condition\n- Children takes up #mental-real-estate: #guilt, anxiety \n- Consumer parenting: the culture that kids are entitled to parent's attention at all time. Hence parents do not have protected time for their own needs. \n\n##### Middle Childhood:\n- Children's personalities and habits are more likely to reflect who they are as adults.  Parents' decisions and directions carry larger consequence. \n- #concerted-cultivation \n\t-  parent's attempt to foster their child's talent by incooporating organized activities in thier children's lives. Middle-class parents often see it as their responsibility to cultivate their children. \n\t- place intense labour on parents, both mentally and logistically \n\t- children of concerted cultivation are afriad of boredom and have not developed the ability to occupy themselces, they often feel entitled to adult's attention and intervention in their play\n\n##### Adolescence\n- Problems faced by Adolescents are less generic. It's more difficult for parents to seek help and relate to each other.  \n- Adolescence challenges parents' ego.\n\t- Less physcial control: Between fifth and twelfth grades, the proporotion of waking hours that children spent with their families dropped from 35 to 14%.\n- Having a child of the same sex opens up uncomfortable opportunity for identification. Children's struggles often reflects adult's struggles when they were younger, which leads to feelings of shame and guilt.\n- In early childhood, parents struggle to get me-time because of their child's reliance. During adolescence, parents struggle to get enough time with children. When children are no longer in the spotlight, parents are redirected to examine their own life, exposing what was fulfilling about it and what was not. Ironically, early parts of childhood are awful for construction of personal identity for the parents. \n\t\n\n#### Some ideas on how child-rearing affects marriage \n- Children are often prioritized over partners. Most people feel far worse about betraying thier children than about betraying their partner. Likely due to the sense of #guilt associated with children. \n- Children's activities often require full involvement from parents (ie. Cub Scout, homework). Couple time is no longer prioritized. \n\n\n#### Why then do we continue to have children?\n- Children give adults structure and purpose \n\t- More rule doesn't mean less freedom. Freedom exists in multiple dimensions. Rules can deliberate us even as they bind.\n\t\u003e One is freed of the constant pressure of trying to maximize emotional returns\n- Children free us from etiquettes and rule-observing tendencies \n- Children are more body focused and adults are more head focused. Children help us reconnect with our body and doing things with our hands. \n- Gift-love vs Need-love. \n\t- Gift-love elicit longing to give, protect and serve.\n\t- Need-love elicit feeling of \"I can't live without you\"\n\t- Adults tend to Gift-love, children tend to need-love. Children's love feels more special becuase we are not used to it. \n- Children bring joy\n\t\u003e Joy is connection. Joy is very different from the kind of pleasure one gets from pursuing excitment or satisfying a drive. Those pleasures tend to be intense and ephemeral. They turn individuals inward, while joy turns the individual outward, toward others. Excitement, secual ecstasty, and happiness all speed up the heart; joy and cuddling slow the heart.\t\n\t\n\t- if joy is connection, then joy and vulnerability must co-exist. You can't have joy without the prospect of mourning, and to some people this makes joy a difficult feeling to bear.\n--- \n \n #### Good analogies:\n- Adults have spotlight consciousness and small children have lantern liked consciousness. \n- Children are very focused on the present. Everyone is moving at the same speed towards the future, but young children are moving at the same speed with their eyes closed. \n\t- This could explain why children are bad at stopping activities (ie. \"Let's go home now and we will come back some other day\"). They have a hard time understanding the future. \n- Philosphy as adults' attempt to deal with the genuinely baffling questions of childhood\n- Adolescents as race car drivers and parents as pit crew. Parents change all of her tires, polish up the car and get out of the way. \n---\n\nPersonal privacy and liberty to pursue one's interest is a modern concept. The #architecture of the typical Puritian home consists of one main room, which conspired against solitude. \n\nAlong the same vein, pervasive busyness is also a modern concept. This led to the decline of #mutual-aid and #pop-ins. \n\n---\n\n#Guilt is an emotion that becomes prominent during parenthood. Parents feel a need to give their very best to their children. This applies both materialistically (ie. school, toys) and non-materialisitically (time). But there is no limit to what constitues best, there's always something more a parent can do. This constant feel of not doing enough leads to guilt. \n\n---\n\nAccording to Anthropologist, Margaret Mead, Americans are not hidebound by traditions and rigid social structures. This is unlike the UK or China, where there is a \"sureness of folkways\". Freedom is embraced and new generations are encouraged to reinvent themselves. Parents prepare their kids to surpass them in unimaginable ways. This uncertainty leads to discontent, and thus willingness to experiment with new education products.\n\nThe lack of clarity on what's possible means we tend to fall back on vague metric like individual happiness, which cannot be sought directly. \"Happiness is the by-product of other worthwhile activities\". Amy Chua of Tiger Mother believes that the society should aim for excellence instead. Happiness from a job well done is the best kind of happiness. It leads to lasting esteem.\n\nTelling young children \"Do what makes you feel happy\" seems rather irresponsible. Children have a screwed definition of what happiness mean due to their lack of life experiences. Encouraging kids to do things against their wishes have its merits. The key lies in how we do it (ie. external rewards, authoritative parenting) and how we justify it to our kids.\n\n---\n\nChildren enjoy #video-games because they provide opportunities for #flow. It provides a sense of mastery that is quicker and more direct than modern day life.\n\n---\n\nAdolescents make poor judgement not because of their ability to estimate risk. They actually overestimate risk when it comes to situation involving their own morality. They make poor judgement because they assign a greater value to the reward they will get from taking that risks that adults do. (B.  J. Casey)\n\nOlder childreen tend to act out, becasue our culture gives them too few chances to take constructive, and tangibly relevant risks (ie. rigid examination system, school rules). Creating outlets for older children to express themselves and experiment is extremely important.\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-26T20:39:56.233031762Z","tags":null},"/read/School-Architecture-Deep-Dive":{"title":"School Architecture Deep Dive","content":"\n**Pre-civil war:**\nConcept of schooling is tied strongly to the school house \n\nConversion from one-room school house to larger education institution\n- galvanize support for universal education\n- improve student experience\n- elevate teacheer status \n\n**Civil War \u0026 Post civil war period:**\n- dependence on children's salary for survival \n- ~ 6 % of 14 - 18 yo Americans were enrolled in high school\n\nWhen the concept of childhood is recognised, new law enforced to get children off the job and into schools.

I think of these services as a security net and a compass.\nThey also provide lessons to parents to have help them understand the effect of their action on their children's development. For programs targeting parents of younger children, these lessons are acommpanied with cash rewards and free lunches to attract parents. As the target age of the children increases, the amount of external incentives decreases and parents are encouraged to attend for the sake of their children. \n\n2) they provide full-time programs to a selective group of children and part-time enrichment programs.\nThey create a pipeline to ensure that they see a small group of children through to adulthood. This pipeline defy the negative impact of their community.\nThey also open up enrichment classes to the wider community, so that the kids who did not go through the pipeline will be more ready to receive changes brought about by the kids who did. \n\n\n#### The ladder:\nCanon Analogy: If you fired a cannon from the top of thre highest moutain inthe world, the cannonball might travel a long way, but it would eventually fall to earth beacuse of the power of gravity. And the faster you shot the canonnball, the farther it would travel before falling to earth. And if you shoot the cannonball fast enough, it will actually escape earth's gravity and go into orbit. \n\nA single program for poor children is not enough to provide escape velocity, to give the children the momentum to orbit their communities and not be damaged. The gravity of the community always pulls the child back down, they may stay in the air for a year or to, but eventually, they will begin to fall closer and closer back down to the values and performance level of the community. A series of program is needed to escape velocity. The key is to intervene younger and guide them with external stimulation for as long as possible. \n\n##### HCZ's pipeline:\n- Baby College\n\t- Weekly parenting classes \n\t- Parents were not made to feel that they were inferior, or being given a favor. Instead, they were made to feel appreciated and doing a good civic deed.\n\t- \"We want you to come and share your expertises\", Instructors solicited ideas and opinons from parents, with plenty og praise and sparing amount of criticism.\n- Harlem Gem Kindergarten\n- Three-year-old journey\n\t- Weekly parenting classes\n- Pre-kindergarten classes\n\t- Language focused\n- Promise Academy\n\t- Elementary School \u0026 Middle School\n\t- High emphasis on standardlized testing. Strong emphasis on test scores because scoring well is an efficient way to gaurantee stability in student's future, and also because these scores are the metric used to rank schools. \n\t- Failure of Promise Academy Middle School: Parent believed that the school made a 'promise', hence did not put in effort. School's succcess is highly dependent on paren'ts cooperation (ie. parents need to bring their kids to school)\n\n#### Quotes\n\n\"Seeing poor children without enough to eat made middle-class votes feel sad and guilty. Seeing poor parents who were using welfare checks ot buy steaks and big-screen TVs made them feel indignat and resentful.\"\n\nRemove emphasis on how different policies make people _feel_, instead focus on what different policies and interventions actually accomplish. \n\n\"He didn't think it was right to hold himself or his employees to a looser standard of achievement simply becausee they happened to be making the world a better place\"\n\n\n### Research\n\nResearch by Cognitive Neurologist, Martha Farah:\n- Poorere children lagged most significantly in _language_, _long-term memory_, _working memory_, _cognitive control_\n- Children's scores on language tests were predicted by parent's cognitive stimulation\n- Children's scores on memory tests were predicted by social/emotional nurturance \n\nAccording to Sociologist, Annette Lareau:\n- Middle class families follow a strategy known as #concerted-cultivation , where they plan organized activities in their children's life with the intention of aiding their development.

For example, we should be able to identify a predator wether we see its left view or its right view. The same doesn't apply for up-down since our height is fixed and we usually observe a predator at the same vertical angle. --\u003e I wonder if sea animals / birds are also more left-right agnostic than top-down agnostic, since they are able to traverse a 3D space and observe anything from all angles. \n- The left and right side of human body is symmetrical. Hence, we don't have a good mental model to distinguish between left and right. Ben hypothesize that ambidexterity could be correlated to how left-right agnostic we are. --\u003e I wonder why we are left-right symmetric and not top-down symmetric. Is there biological reasoning behind this? \n\n#### False Beliefs \n\nOur confidence in false beliefs is informed by our perception of other people's stance. Kidd Lab's research shows that people were more likely to adjust their confidence in believing a  misinformation when they were informed that 8 in 10 people believe in the same belief than when they were informed that 2 in 10 people believe in the same belief. \n\nI wonder how the way we present other people's stance will impact our confidence in false beliefs.

The insanely fascinating talk was by biological anthropologist, (Rachna Reddy)[https://scholar.harvard.edu/rachnareddy/home]\n\nhere's what I learned: \n- Chimpanzees live in communities! Each community is closed off and has their designated territories. Male chimps do border patrol of the communities territories. Chimps are extremely hostile towards outsiders. \n- Chimps can live into their 70s. Chimps go through adolescence just like humans do.\n- Female adolescent chimps will leave for other communities, cutting off ALL TIES with their exisiting family. While chimps are usually hostile towards outsiders, they are not hostile towards foreign female adolescent chimps. Female adolescent chimps will 'date around' and explore other communities before settling into their chosen community. Why female adolescent chimps are incentivized to leave and how they choose their new communities are both open questions. \n- Chimps have status within the community. Status of a chimp can be determined by their grunt when they greet each other. Grunts can vary based on intensity and length. \n\t- The statuses of female chimps are determined in their adolescence and remain relatively stable. Research has shown that female status has profound effects on food access, infant survival and offspring social success.

For a long time, I thought the solution to recognizing the importance of caregiving is perfect empathy - if everyone weight their need and other people's needs equally then we ought to have a more caring society. But  simply demanding perfect empathy is unrealistic, at least for now. The idea of compromising on our own needs for another's goes against our evolutionary instinct. In order for perfect empathy to exists, there has to be trust - I will look out for your needs if I trust that you are also looking out for mine. But if any one agent decides to break the rule, then the trust will be broken and we will all be incentivized to selfish again!\n\nSo how do we create a system of trust? Well, historically we have done so through contracts, in other words by signing a legally enforceable agreement! So why don't we have contracts for caregiving too? The caregiving contract could clearly outlines the duty of the caregiver, their compensation (if any) and the duration etc. It would be sign by the person who needs care and their nominated caregiver (who doesn't necessary has to be a family member). The government could provide subsidies or benefit payment to caregivers based on the nature of care they provide, akin to [paid family leave](https://edd.ca.gov/disability/paid-family-leave/). \n\nAt first, it didn't sit well with me that we could mix caregiving, something that so rooted in love, with a legal contract, something so black and white. I worried that we would stop caring naturally for one another altogther. Then I realized that this is a tried and tested practise - marriage is after all a legal contract built upon love! We don't stop loving our partner just because that love is legally recognized by the government. Similarly, a legal contract around caregiving shouldn't diminish the love that makes caregiving possible. Instead, it legitimizes the relationship and recognizes the work involved and helps to sustain that love! \n\nThat's not to say that caregiving contract is an replacement for perfect empathy! it's extremely important that we work towards being a kinder and more empathetic society. But until we have a BCI that allows us to know exactly how one is feeling (It's very debatable if that's even a good thing, rabbit hole for another timeüê∞), a caregiving contract is a much more realisitc and attainable goal!\n\n---\nCrediting this thought to my PI, Alison Gopnik, who has been a proponent of legitimizing caregiving, for sparring with me when I questioned her about this concept!\n","lastmodified":"2022-10-26T20:39:56.237031852Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Designing-a-playful-city":{"title":"Designing a playful city","content":"How can we make cities more playful?

One prominent case study I read about recently is YuanFuDao's award system. YuanFuDao is China's largest edtech company and their award system perpetuates through every segment of their online tuition center.\n\n#### YuanFuDao's gamified system:\n\n###### Currency system\n-   Coins given for good behavior, participation in class, answering questions correctly etc.\n-   Coins can be exchange for more tutoring lessons or tuition center's merchandise.\n-   Teachers emphasis importance of collecting coins \u0026 promote store items (Using phrases like \"you don't want to miss this\")\n\n###### Title system\n-   Students given title based on ability to answer questions in class. Title seems to reset for every class.\n-   Student's title tagged to class' online chat.\n-   Leaderboard shown at the end of the class\n\nThere seems to be 2 opposing schools of thoughts on external rewards. People arguing against external rewards generally believe that the presence of such rewards diminishes one's internal motivation. Hence children are unlikely to behave accordingly in the absence of external rewards, which opposes our goal of helping children cultivate life-long habits.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious to me wether external reward is effective / detrimental to children's long term growth. So I looked into some major theories behind this topic. Here's my notes:\n\nDistinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation:\n\nExam score on its own is not a form of external reward. Assuming exam scores are indicative of one's ability, a student who is working towards a higher score for the pursuit of excellence / mastery of skills is internally motivated, while a student who is trying to score higher for praises and validations from those around him is externally motivated.\n\n##### 1. Cognitive evaluation theory:\n\n###### In intrinsically motivating events:\n\n-   Changes in basic psychological needs in Self-Determination Theory--\u003e changes in Intrinsic motivation\n\n-   External rewards ‚Äî\u003e detrimental effect on the persistence of free choice (Autonomy) ‚Äî\u003e decrease in intrinsic motivation\n-   Unexpected external rewards \u0026 non-controlling rewards --\u003e Increase in competence (Competence)--\u003e Increase in Intrinsic motivation\n\n###### In events that are not intrinsically motivating:\n-   Rewards does not decrease internal motivation\n\n##### 2. Overjustification effect\n\n-   Expected external inventive decreases person's intrinsic motivation to perform task\n-   Human credits motivation to rewards, undermining pre-existing intrinsic motivation\n-   [Study at South Methodist University](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-25824-001) ¬†--\u003e Intrinsic motivation dependent on perceived competence\n\n#####  [3. General Interest theory](http://classweb.uh.edu/eisenberger/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/04/06_Effects_of_Reward_on_Intrinsic_Motivation.pdf)\n\n-   Effect of intrinsic motivation extends beyond effect on autonomy and competence\n-   \"The content of tasks, and the context in which they are presented, including reward, increase intrinsic motivation when they convey that task performance helps satisfy needs, wants, or desires.\"\n\n-   Reward influence intrinsic motivation by symbolic function\n-   Type/Context/Nature of reward conveys importance of being competent, perception of competence, identification with the task giver's judgement of the task as important\n\n-   People tend to evaluate their competence based on relative performance with their peers (#Questions Is this innate?). Rewards that reflect relative performance tend to lead to large increase in intrinsic motivation\n\n#### Thoughts:\n\nSo it seems like the theory of intrinsic motivation vs external reward is a lot more nuanced than the more broad generalization I have heard amongst the education community.\n\nThe long term effectiveness of external reward is highly dependent on its context. External rewards should be implemented such that it doesn't hinder a child's perceived autonomy and it should build up the child's perceived competence.\n\n-   It seems to me that designing a reward system that builds up a child's perceived competence for a particular skill is tricky especially if the system is broad based to the entire classroom. Oftentimes, building up one child's confidence would indirectly negatively impact another's. Tailored reward system seems to be the way to go but this certainly requires an educator that really cares about every child and has the bandwidth to track their progress individually (I wonder how ML can help in this).\n\nOne interesting point brought up by the general interest theory is the internalization of external motivations. Rewards from authority for a certain action coveys desirability of the action. Somethings (ie. eating healthy) are certainly desirable but not intuitively obvious to kids or we are not internally motivated to do so. In these cases, reward systems can be employed to convey such desirability, however, it must be designed to be weaned off eventually.\n\nIn cases, where children are not intrinsically motivated to act a certain way and where there is no long term consequence of the lack of such intrinsic motivation, external rewards can be an efficient and fun way to give adults a peace of mind.\n\n‚Äç  \n#### Questions:\n\n-   Are children intrinsically motivated to act kindly? If we were to do design a reward system around kindness, how should it look it?","lastmodified":"2022-10-26T20:39:56.237031852Z","tags":null},"/thoughts/Learn-Work-Retirement":{"title":"Learn -\u003e Work -\u003e Retirement","content":"\nSociety has this notion that jobs/careers are life-long.

During my initial attempt, my buddy and I exhausted every possible way one could say \"You are really funny\" in just about a minute.\n\nThe trick to this exercise involves being more intentional about your buddy's emotion and less intentional about the ways one could say the same sentence.

The current pipeline to becoming a doctor is unnecessarily competitive. And it seems to me that this is deliberately created for economic benefits. Putting so many people through a rat race just to retain artificial prestige seems like a huge waste of human talent. \n\n--- \n\nOur tendency to conform as adults is largely shaped by the the rigidity of our social circles when we are younger. As kids, we are exposed to a finite set of people and this group of people remain relatively unchange. This makes being able to fit in extremely crucial, which consequently stunts individuality and originality. Giving kids the mean to find their people (in a safe way) seems crucial. \n\n---\nIt seems to me that an understanding of our physical surroundings and its mechanisms is a necessary precuresor to the understanding of more abstract concepts. \n\nHere's a possible hypothesis:\n\nWe live in a physical world, we are able to manipulate physcial objects, and watched other people do the same. We collect data points and develope an intuitive understanding of physical concepts. Which then becomes an interface to more abstract concepts. A example of this would be using blocks to learn counting. Blocks are physical. Numbers are abstract. \n\nI wonder how much our fine-motor ability comes in our way of understanding more abstract knowledge. If we are able to fundamentally change the way we interact with this world, and somehow allow us to directly interface with abstract concepts without advance physical devleopment. Then perhaps we could speed up the rate of learning.\n\n---\n\nWe are adversed to failure, boredom and messes. It becomes seocnd nature for us to protect our kids from these experiences.\n\n---\n\nIt seems difficult to introduce interactive machine assisted learning to young children (2-3), because they have yet to develope a standardized method for communication (communication comes hand in hand with emotion identification and regulation). If any tech is introduced, it will most likely be some form of SaS that interface with the teachers. Examples could be streamlining logistics and creating personalized learning plans.\n\nEarly educators are special because their knowledge is very specific to what they practice. This is unlike someone who studies say Physics, who can then become an engineer, a researcher or a physics teacher.\n\nThe bulk of the human resouces in education should be devoted towards early education. \n\nEarly ed is not simply childcare. I think the struggle of early years educators is identifying what young children need and figuring out which method is effective in assisting their needs. What does preschool teacher training entail?\n\nPersonal hunch right now is that innovation in early childhood education is not super dire, at least compared to the later years. We do have a few tried and tested models that are working (ie. reggio emilia, forest school, montessori, mixed ability classrooms, project based), and these models tend to optimize for overall human flourishing thanks to the lack of standardized testing in early years.\n\nWhat could be useful: \n- a list of children's congitive development needs and guidelines to assist children in their needs - It's important that early educators not just understand what to do, but also the scientific reasons behind their actions.\n\n---\n\nPublic education system should not encourage children to optimize for limited resource. When the improvement of one self is at the detriment of someone else, we will never be able to achieve collective excellence. We tend to mistake sarcity as prestrige, this skews our judgement and distracts us from working on what's truly meaningful to us. Instead, we should create a system where children can optimize for unlimited resource like kindness and skill mastery. \n\n---\n\nKindness should not just be externally measuerd, they should also be measured through self-reflection.\n\nIn general, children should be encouraged to regularly evaluate themselves. Establishing good self-understanding of one's ability - how much do I truly understand something - requires calibration. And a strong understanding of self is fundamental to our ability to call out our own bullshit. \n\n---\nI wonder how \"work\" and \"life\" should interact. Right now, there's common consensus that there should be a clear separation between work and life. This separation applies broadly to all dimensions (ie. physical location, time, mental).
