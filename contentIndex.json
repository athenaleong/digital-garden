    "content": "- Both of my friends who came to me about their problems recently went in circles about the same few points. I find myself making this mistake all the time too - It's very easy to fall into the same spiral of thoughts when the problem has no ideal solution. Sometimes, It's just more comforting to dwell on 'what to do' then actually doing it. But that's extremely unproductive and really bad for long term happiness! Knowing when to step out of the spiral and just deal with the problem seems like an extremely important skill.\n- I have a vague feeling that my degree of self-compassion is inversely correlated with my degree of definite optimism. I'm still trying to figure out why.\n - Overdependency on things outside of my control is one of the most draining things I have experienced. \n- I haven't been very well physcially and I realized how much I take my health for granted. I find the process of figuring out what is important really passive - we have to lose something in order to understand its true value. What are some ways to change that? \n- I realized that some of the best builders I know don't promote themselves and some of the best promoters (people who claim to build or who talks about building on social media) never actually builds.",

    "content": "#### Spatial Context \n Animals, including humans, traditionally have a harder time disitinguishing between left-right than up-down or front-back. \n\n2 Hypthoesise that could explain this:\n-  It's adventageous for survival that we don't distinguish left-right. For example, we should be able to identify a predator wether we see its left view or its right view. The same doesn't apply for up-down since our height is fixed and we usually observe a predator at the same vertical angle. --\u003e I wonder if sea animals / birds are also more left-right agnostic than top-down agnostic, since they are able to traverse a 3D space and observe anything from all angles. \n- The left and right side of human body is symmetrical. Hence, we don't have a good mental model to distinguish between left and right. Ben hypothesize that ambidexterity could be correlated to how left-right agnostic we are. --\u003e I wonder why we are left-right symmetric and not top-down symmetric. Is there biological reasoning behind this? \n\n#### False Beliefs \n\nOur confidence in false beliefs is informed by our perception of other people's stance. Kidd Lab's research shows that people were more likely to adjust their confidence in believing a  misinformation when they were informed that 8 in 10 people believe in the same belief than when they were informed that 2 in 10 people believe in the same belief. \n\nI wonder how the way we present other people's stance will impact our confidence in false beliefs. (ie., the difference between telling someone 8 in 10 people believe in X vs 80 in 100 people believe in X). This could inform how we design rating systems in social media. \n\nApproaching belief formation from bayesian standpoint\n\n- Observers combine signals from different perceptual senses to arrive at unified percept\n- Learners integrate private information and social informaiton to form beliefs\n\n![Bayesian Cue Integration Framework](https://d3i71xaburhd42.cloudfront.net/ccf8df0bb60ec3f98d9dbfff98be4cf32548299b/7-Figure2-1.png)",

    "content": "Colloqium today was on Adolescene in Chimpanzees and Bonoboos. The insanely fascinating talk was by biological anthropologist, (Rachna Reddy)[https://scholar.harvard.edu/rachnareddy/home]\n\nhere's what I learned: \n- Chimpanzees live in communities! Each community is closed off and has their designated territories. Male chimps do border patrol of the communities territories. Chimps are extremely hostile towards outsiders. \n- Chimps can live into their 70s. Chimps go through adolescence just like humans do.\n- Female adolescent chimps will leave for other communities, cutting off ALL TIES with their exisiting family. While chimps are usually hostile towards outsiders, they are not hostile towards foreign female adolescent chimps. Female adolescent chimps will 'date around' and explore other communities before settling into their chosen community. Why female adolescent chimps are incentivized to leave and how they choose their new communities are both open questions. \n- Chimps have status within the community. Status of a chimp can be determined by their grunt when they greet each other. Grunts can vary based on intensity and length. \n\t- The statuses of female chimps are determined in their adolescence and remain relatively stable. Research has shown that female status has profound effects on food access, infant survival and offspring social success. Offsprings of low ranking female chimp may be killed by male chimps in the same community (infanticide)[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190613121023.htm] \n\n\t![Female Chimp Status](/thoughts/images/female-chimps.jpeg)\n\n\t- The statuses of male chimps are more fluid. Research has shown that male chimps can be reproductively successful even if they are low-ranking. Chimps tend not to engage in status competition when they are young. \n\n\t![MaleChimp Status](/thoughts/images/male-chimps.jpeg)\n\t\n- Mentorship exists in chimps! Older 'mentors' are important for social integration for females of both species and male chimpanzees\n\nBiology Anthropology is a new field for me so everything is so new and fascinating!\nI think it's interesting that female adolescent chimps seems to be wired to leave their family! Rachna mentioned that female adolescent chimps would leave their communities even if there's no other communities to go to - they found a female chimp just sitting alone in a farmland doing nothing. It is as if \"they just had to leave\". I wonder how much of this phenomenon is genetically programmed into chimps. And if it is indeed genetics, I wonder how much this could explain the behaviors we observe in human adolescents.",

    "title": "Contract for Caregiving",
    "content": "---\n\nWe spend a lot of time on giving care, but the value of caregiving is under-recognized, in fact, it is not even part of the economy. For a long time, I thought the solution to recognizing the importance of caregiving is perfect empathy - if everyone weight their need and other people's needs equally then we ought to have a more caring society. But  simply demanding perfect empathy is unrealistic, at least for now. The idea of compromising on our own needs for another's goes against our evolutionary instinct. In order for perfect empathy to exists, there has to be trust - I will look out for your needs if I trust that you are also looking out for mine. But if any one agent decides to break the rule, then the trust will be broken and we will all be incentivized to selfish again!\n\nSo how do we create a system of trust? Well, historically we have done so through contracts, in other words by signing a legally enforceable agreement! So why don't we have contracts for caregiving too? The caregiving contract could clearly outlines the duty of the caregiver, their compensation (if any) and the duration etc. It would be sign by the person who needs care and their nominated caregiver (who doesn't necessary has to be a family member). The government could provide subsidies or benefit payment to caregivers based on the nature of care they provide, akin to [paid family leave](https://edd.ca.gov/disability/paid-family-leave/). \n\nAt first, it didn't sit well with me that we could mix caregiving, something that so rooted in love, with a legal contract, something so black and white. I worried that we would stop caring naturally for one another altogther. Then I realized that this is a tried and tested practise - marriage is after all a legal contract built upon love! We don't stop loving our partner just because that love is legally recognized by the government. Similarly, a legal contract around caregiving shouldn't diminish the love that makes caregiving possible. Instead, it legitimizes the relationship and recognizes the work involved and helps to sustain that love! \n\nThat's not to say that caregiving contract is an replacement for perfect empathy! it's extremely important that we work towards being a kinder and more empathetic society. But until we have a BCI that allows us to know exactly how one is feeling (It's very debatable if that's even a good thing, rabbit hole for another timeüê∞), a caregiving contract is a much more realisitc and attainable goal!",

    "content": "How can we make cities more playful? Collective play makes you feel alive, it is one of the best way to connect with those around you! The exploratorium is great at doing this. The exhibit where you need to hold hands with others in order to activate the music is simply magical. You need to work collectively to make something happen -  It brings people together! The act of holding hands breaks the physcial barrier in a fun and non-threatning way. It brings happiness to not just the participants but also the beholders. When happiness is shared, it is amplified (though it should still feel exlcusive / maintain the feeling of huamn connection) . When we play collectively, it feels like we are harmonising in a whole different universe!\n\nFeatures of a more playful city:\n-  Collaboration. (think 4 ppl snake game where each person controls a direction)\n- Work with mediums that has feel good effect (think music, solving puzzles)\n- Enabling medium. People can use thier imagination and creativity to make the play special.",

  "/thoughts/Is-external-reward-useful": {
    "title": "Is External Reward Useful?",
    "content": "Note from 2021: \n\nEducators often use external rewards to encourage children to do the 'right' thing. One prominent case study I read about recently is YuanFuDao's award system. YuanFuDao is China's largest edtech company and their award system perpetuates through every segment of their online tuition center.\n\n#### YuanFuDao's gamified system:\n\n###### Currency system\n-   Coins given for good behavior, participation in class, answering questions correctly etc.\n-   Coins can be exchange for more tutoring lessons or tuition center's merchandise.\n-   Teachers emphasis importance of collecting coins \u0026 promote store items (Using phrases like \"you don't want to miss this\")\n\n###### Title system\n-   Students given title based on ability to answer questions in class. Title seems to reset for every class.\n-   Student's title tagged to class' online chat.\n-   Leaderboard shown at the end of the class\n\nThere seems to be 2 opposing schools of thoughts on external rewards. People arguing against external rewards generally believe that the presence of such rewards diminishes one's internal motivation. Hence children are unlikely to behave accordingly in the absence of external rewards, which opposes our goal of helping children cultivate life-long habits.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious to me wether external reward is effective / detrimental to children's long term growth. So I looked into some major theories behind this topic. Here's my notes:\n\nDistinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation:\n\nExam score on its own is not a form of external reward. Assuming exam scores are indicative of one's ability, a student who is working towards a higher score for the pursuit of excellence / mastery of skills is internally motivated, while a student who is trying to score higher for praises and validations from those around him is externally motivated.\n\n##### 1. Cognitive evaluation theory:\n\n###### In intrinsically motivating events:\n\n-   Changes in basic psychological needs in Self-Determination Theory--\u003e changes in Intrinsic motivation\n\n-   External rewards ‚Äî\u003e detrimental effect on the persistence of free choice (Autonomy) ‚Äî\u003e decrease in intrinsic motivation\n-   Unexpected external rewards \u0026 non-controlling rewards --\u003e Increase in competence (Competence)--\u003e Increase in Intrinsic motivation\n\n###### In events that are not intrinsically motivating:\n-   Rewards does not decrease internal motivation\n\n##### 2. Overjustification effect\n\n-   Expected external inventive decreases person's intrinsic motivation to perform task\n-   Human credits motivation to rewards, undermining pre-existing intrinsic motivation\n-   [Study at South Methodist University](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1981-25824-001) ¬†--\u003e Intrinsic motivation dependent on perceived competence\n\n#####  [3. General Interest theory](http://classweb.uh.edu/eisenberger/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/04/06_Effects_of_Reward_on_Intrinsic_Motivation.pdf)\n\n-   Effect of intrinsic motivation extends beyond effect on autonomy and competence\n-   \"The content of tasks, and the context in which they are presented, including reward, increase intrinsic motivation when they convey that task performance helps satisfy needs, wants, or desires.\"\n\n-   Reward influence intrinsic motivation by symbolic function\n-   Type/Context/Nature of reward conveys importance of being competent, perception of competence, identification with the task giver's judgement of the task as important\n\n-   People tend to evaluate their competence based on relative performance with their peers (#Questions Is this innate?). Rewards that reflect relative performance tend to lead to large increase in intrinsic motivation\n\n#### Thoughts:\n\nSo it seems like the theory of intrinsic motivation vs external reward is a lot more nuanced than the more broad generalization I have heard amongst the education community.\n\nThe long term effectiveness of external reward is highly dependent on its context. External rewards should be implemented such that it doesn't hinder a child's perceived autonomy and it should build up the child's perceived competence.\n\n-   It seems to me that designing a reward system that builds up a child's perceived competence for a particular skill is tricky especially if the system is broad based to the entire classroom. Oftentimes, building up one child's confidence would indirectly negatively impact another's. Tailored reward system seems to be the way to go but this certainly requires an educator that really cares about every child and has the bandwidth to track their progress individually (I wonder how ML can help in this).\n\nOne interesting point brought up by the general interest theory is the internalization of external motivations. Rewards from authority for a certain action coveys desirability of the action. Somethings (ie. eating healthy) are certainly desirable but not intuitively obvious to kids or we are not internally motivated to do so. In these cases, reward systems can be employed to convey such desirability, however, it must be designed to be weaned off eventually.\n\nIn cases, where children are not intrinsically motivated to act a certain way and where there is no long term consequence of the lack of such intrinsic motivation, external rewards can be an efficient and fun way to give adults a peace of mind.\n\n‚Äç  \n#### Questions:\n\n-   Are children intrinsically motivated to act kindly? If we were to do design a reward system around kindness, how should it look it?",

Learning resources are no longer exclusive to younger people, this means we can support multiple cycles of learning and executing. \n\n- Deciding what to do for the \"rest of your life\" in your late teen is extremely daunting, especially since our education system doesn't support independent decision-making. I know many people who gave up their interest for traditionally sought-after careers because they are afraid of making a lifelong commitment to something that doesn't guarantee stability. \n\n- The problem faced by our society is multi-faceted. We need individuals that are well-informed in many areas. We also need individuals who are great at learning, the best way to guarantee this is to make learning a habit. \n\n- This model kills innovation/ human agency. People get too comfortable when they think their career is meant to be lifelong. \n\nPerhaps a new model of life should be this?

    "title": "Repetition \u0026 Giving Love",
    "content": "I did an exercise called repetition in theater class today. \n\nThe instruction was simple: find a buddy, come up with a random sentence, and take turn repeating the same sentence to each other in different ways for 5 mintue.\n\nEven though the instruciton was straightforward, the exercise itself felt impossible. During my initial attempt, my buddy and I exhausted every possible way one could say \"You are really funny\" in just about a minute.\n\nThe trick to this exercise involves being more intentional about your buddy's emotion and less intentional about the ways one could say the same sentence. Once my focus shifted from 'How can I vary my intonation' to  'What is my buddy trying to convery to me', it became really natural to respond back and we managed to come up with a whole storyline. \n\nThis exercise reminds me of how we should give love. \n\nI used to have this misconception that love in itself is enough, but I now think that there are right and wrong ways to give love. The right way to show love should be informed by how the other party wants to receive love and not how you want to receive love. The focus should be on the other person. Showering someone with love without understanding what they appreciate may actually hurt them.\n\nOn a tangential note, I think a good way to understand how one wants to receive love is by observing how one instinctively display love to others. I hypothesized that this to be exceptionally true for younger kids.",

Learning problem solving skills \n\nOnly a small percentage of math topics actually contributes to our development in the first way.

They contributes to our learning largely though the second and third way. But there are many ways to accomplish these implicit goals, and forcing children to learn uninteresting theorems they can't relate to defintely isn't effective.\n\nMy thinking is that only the most important topic should be part of the compulsory math syllabus.

    "content": "#### Teaching \u0026 learning of probability is categorized into 3 philosophical approaches:\n\n1. Classical: Formal definition of probabilities in terms of sample spaces of equally likely events, based on a strict set of axioms. Defines probability as a fraction of the number of favorables cases to a particular event divided by the number of all cases possible. Common example: ball being selected from urns\n2. Frequentist: Defines probability of an event as the long-run relative frequency of the event. In other words, the number in which freqency of the event tend towards when an experiment is repeated an infinite number of times. Often taught via simulation. \n\t- Good for confirming intuition, but needs to be complemented with classical approach to understand the 'why?'\n3. Subjective: Defines probability as a degree of belief, based upon personal judgement and information about an outcome, in which the reptition of the same situation is no longer necessary to give a sense to probability. \n\t- Could be introduced at a more advance level, to help students understand that probabilitic thinking is not fully rational and require subjective input. \n\n\t![Approach to teaching probability in Singapore, US and Indonesia](/thoughts/images/teaching-approach-probability.jpeg)\n\n#### A few ways to distinguish Math textbook:\n- Representation forms. Representing math concepts as purely mathematical, written, visual or combined forms. \n- Cogntive demand levels. What level of cognitive demand does textbook question afford? Low cognitive demand - memorization, procedures without connection. High cognitive demand  - Procedure with connection, open-ended math problem. \n- Contextual features. How relevant is problem context to student's everyday life?\n\n#### Synthesising\nWhy teach probability? \n- Framework for thinking and sound decision making. \n\n*Logical understanding* on how probability works is indispensable to the key to the transferability of probabilitistic concepts to real life scenarios. This can best be achieved by setting questions with high cognitive demand, in addition to providing high contextualized examples. \n\nIndonesian textbook sets questions that are high contextualized, but requires low cognitive demand. Their students report low performance on context-based mathemtics tasks; Only 1% of their students could work with context-based problems in complex situations. This is because they do not fundamentally understand the concepts of probability. Completing taks that requires higher congitive demand levels can faciliate a *productive struggle* which helps them make missing connections.",

    "content": "Parent from poor socioeconomic backgrounds are disadvantaged: \n- they may not understand the effect of their action on their children's cognitive development\n- they may not have the cognitive bandwidth to effect change\n-  they may model their actions after unhealthy examples \n-  their parenting approach may be built upon false assumptions\n\nHarmlen Children Zone is an-encompassing programs for poverty-striken children in Harlem. \n\nHarlem Children Zone's approach is two-pronged in many ways.\n\n1) they provide services to both children and parents.\nThey give children a nuturing environement and teach them knowledge, habits and concepts that they would otherwised not be exposed to. I think of these services as a security net and a compass.\nThey also provide lessons to parents to have help them understand the effect of their action on their children's development. For programs targeting parents of younger children, these lessons are acommpanied with cash rewards and free lunches to attract parents. As the target age of the children increases, the amount of external incentives decreases and parents are encouraged to attend for the sake of their children. \n\n2) they provide full-time programs to a selective group of children and part-time enrichment programs.\nThey create a pipeline to ensure that they see a small group of children through to adulthood. This pipeline defy the negative impact of their community.\nThey also open up enrichment classes to the wider community, so that the kids who did not go through the pipeline will be more ready to receive changes brought about by the kids who did. \n\n\n#### The ladder:\nCanon Analogy: If you fired a cannon from the top of thre highest moutain inthe world, the cannonball might travel a long way, but it would eventually fall to earth beacuse of the power of gravity. And the faster you shot the canonnball, the farther it would travel before falling to earth. And if you shoot the cannonball fast enough, it will actually escape earth's gravity and go into orbit. \n\nA single program for poor children is not enough to provide escape velocity, to give the children the momentum to orbit their communities and not be damaged. The gravity of the community always pulls the child back down, they may stay in the air for a year or to, but eventually, they will begin to fall closer and closer back down to the values and performance level of the community. A series of program is needed to escape velocity. The key is to intervene younger and guide them with external stimulation for as long as possible. \n\n##### HCZ's pipeline:\n- Baby College\n\t- Weekly parenting classes \n\t- Parents were not made to feel that they were inferior, or being given a favor. Instead, they were made to feel appreciated and doing a good civic deed.\n\t- \"We want you to come and share your expertises\", Instructors solicited ideas and opinons from parents, with plenty og praise and sparing amount of criticism.\n- Harlem Gem Kindergarten\n- Three-year-old journey\n\t- Weekly parenting classes\n- Pre-kindergarten classes\n\t- Language focused\n- Promise Academy\n\t- Elementary School \u0026 Middle School\n\t- High emphasis on standardlized testing. Strong emphasis on test scores because scoring well is an efficient way to gaurantee stability in student's future, and also because these scores are the metric used to rank schools. \n\t- Failure of Promise Academy Middle School: Parent believed that the school made a 'promise', hence did not put in effort. School's succcess is highly dependent on paren'ts cooperation (ie. parents need to bring their kids to school)\n\n#### Quotes\n\n\"Seeing poor children without enough to eat made middle-class votes feel sad and guilty. Seeing poor parents who were using welfare checks ot buy steaks and big-screen TVs made them feel indignat and resentful.\"\n\nRemove emphasis on how different policies make people _feel_, instead focus on what different policies and interventions actually accomplish. \n\n\"He didn't think it was right to hold himself or his employees to a looser standard of achievement simply becausee they happened to be making the world a better place\"\n\n\n### Research\n\nResearch by Cognitive Neurologist, Martha Farah:\n- Poorere children lagged most significantly in _language_, _long-term memory_, _working memory_, _cognitive control_\n- Children's scores on language tests were predicted by parent's cognitive stimulation\n- Children's scores on memory tests were predicted by social/emotional nurturance \n\nAccording to Sociologist, Annette Lareau:\n- Middle class families follow a strategy known as _concerted cultivation_, where they plan organized activities in their children's life with the intention of aiding their development. These children are viewed as _apprentice adults_ and are encourages to _ask questions_, and _challenge current thinking_\n- Middle class parents view their children's activities as their own responsibility and tend to get involved (though sometimes obsessively)\n- Concerted cultivated children tend to have less freedom in their everday activites, but more freedom in talking back, questioning authority and challenging rules \u0026 consequences. \n- Working-class and poor families allow their children much more freedom in planning their own time, but are told to defer decision making to adults and treat them with respect. \n- I think that the consequence of these parent styles sound intuitive, but not sure how much parenting style is deteremined by socioeconomic level, as compared to other factors like culture.",
