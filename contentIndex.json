    "content": "Society has this notion that jobs/careers are life-long. For example, If one wants to be a mechanical engineer, they will spend a chunk of time in their early life learning to be a mechanical engineer. Then, they will spend the rest of their life practicing their craft until retirement. \n\n![Traditional life timeline](content/images/traditional-life-timeline.jpeg)\n\nThis model may have worked 60 years ago, probably due to a mixed bag of reasons such as lack of resources, need for specialization, lower expectations for human fulfillment üê∞ . but this model doesn't seem to be ideal for our society now. \n\n- We have the infrastructure to support rapid sharing of knowledge. Learning resources are no longer exclusive to younger people, this means we can support multiple cycles of learning and executing. \n\n- Deciding what to do for the \"rest of your life\" in your late teen is extremely daunting, especially since our education system doesn't support independent decision-making. I know many people who gave up their interest for traditionally sought-after careers because they are afraid of making a lifelong commitment to something that doesn't guarantee stability. \n\n- The problem faced by our society is multi-faceted. We need individuals that are well-informed in many areas. We also need individuals who are great at learning, the best way to guarantee this is to make learning a habit. \n\n- This model kills innovation/ human agency. People get too comfortable when they think their career is meant to be lifelong. \n\nPerhaps a new model of life should be this? Ie. may iterations of learning and executing, with the concept of retirement (taking a break/ relaxation/ do nothing and take in the beauty of life) being something that can take place any time in our life. \n\n![How life should be](/content/images/how-life-should-be.jpeg)",
