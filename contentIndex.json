    "content": "Society has this notion that jobs/careers are life-long. For example, If one wants to be a mechanical engineer, they will spend a chunk of time in their early life learning to be a mechanical engineer. Then, they will spend the rest of their life practicing their craft until retirement. \n\n![Traditional life timeline](/thoughts/images/traditional-life-timeline.jpeg)\n\nThis model may have worked 60 years ago, probably due to a mixed bag of reasons such as lack of resources, need for specialization, lower expectations for human fulfillment üê∞ . but this model doesn't seem to be ideal for our society now. \n\n- We have the infrastructure to support rapid sharing of knowledge. Learning resources are no longer exclusive to younger people, this means we can support multiple cycles of learning and executing. \n\n- Deciding what to do for the \"rest of your life\" in your late teen is extremely daunting, especially since our education system doesn't support independent decision-making. I know many people who gave up their interest for traditionally sought-after careers because they are afraid of making a lifelong commitment to something that doesn't guarantee stability. \n\n- The problem faced by our society is multi-faceted. We need individuals that are well-informed in many areas. We also need individuals who are great at learning, the best way to guarantee this is to make learning a habit. \n\n- This model kills innovation/ human agency. People get too comfortable when they think their career is meant to be lifelong. \n\nPerhaps a new model of life should be this? Ie. may iterations of learning and executing, with the concept of retirement (taking a break/ relaxation/ do nothing and take in the beauty of life) being something that can take place any time in our life. \n\n![How life should be](/thoughts/images/how-life-should-be.jpeg)",

    "title": "Repetition \u0026 Giving Love",
    "content": "I did an exercise called repetition in theater class today. \n\nThe instruction was simple: find a buddy, come up with a random sentence, and take turn repeating the same sentence to each other in different ways for 5 mintue.\n\nEven though the instruciton was straightforward, the exercise itself felt impossible. During my initial attempt, my buddy and I exhausted every possible way one could say \"You are really funny\" in just about a minute.\n\nThe trick to this exercise involves being more intentional about your partner's emotion and less intentional about the ways one could say the same sentence. Once my focus shifted from 'How can I vary my intonation' to  'What is my buddy trying to convery to me', it became really natural to respond back and we somehow came up with a whole storyline from just a single sentence!\n\nThis exercise reminds me of how we should give love. \n\nI used to have this misconception that love in itself is enough, but I now think that there are right and wrong ways to give love. The right way to show love should be informed by how the other party wants to receive love and not how you want to receive love. The focus should be on the other person. Showering someone with love without understanding what they appreciate may actually hurt them.\n\nOn a tangential note, I think a good way to understand how one wants to receive love is by observing how one instinctively display love to others.",

    "title": "Saudade",
    "content": "Finally found a word to embody the complexity of emotions I feel when I have to separate from a person / place / project. \n \n \u003e **Saudade** is a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound longing for something or someone that one cares for and/or loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never be had again. It is the recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events that once brought excitement, pleasure, and well-being, which now trigger the senses and make one experience the pain of separation from those joyous sensations. Saudade describes a feeling both happy and sad.",
